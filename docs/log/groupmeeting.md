## What have done     
    1. Learn the basic code of LaTeX and how to use the Git control system.    
    2. Learn the PCB wiring and layout, and completed the PCB wiring of the 0.0.1 version of the circuit.    
    3. Redesign schematic.    
    
We learned how to use LaTex and wrote a exercise article. Contents, table, picture, reference and equations were all included. The picture of this exercise is shown below.
