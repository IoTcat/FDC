## Issues

 - RF Balun unmatched frequency..
 - 2450M or 450M
 - no 2450M balun 2:1
 - to 450M 80M (820M) 370M
 - Select BALF-SPI2-02D3 on onecall
 - BALF-SPI2-02D3 output impendance not 50 ohms, droped
 - to 610M 80M (1140M) 530M
 - Design IF impedance for 200 ohms
 - Learn [Smith Chart](https://www.maximintegrated.com/cn/design/technical-documents/tutorials/7/742.html)
 - Figure out IF Table on Spec is ||
 - to 610M 80M (1300M) 690M
 - IF 5.6pF 220nH 220nH
