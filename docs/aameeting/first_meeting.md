# The first week meeting
[x] `---30/01/2020  by Yimian Liu`   
[x] `Participaants: Boyao Yang, Weizhou Wen, Yimian Liu, Yidi Song`   
[x] `Location: EE 5 floor AA office`   

## Outline
 - Figure out the key **params of FDC**
 - Think how to **measure** these params
 - There might be a week to wait for the SMT
 - In the waiting time, figure out **measure/test procedure and plan**
 - Always think about the **Report**
 - Use blog to provide `evidence` of proof
 - Its better to conduct the proj **document-oriented** with a check list

## Technical Suggestions
 - **Do not** need a bandpass filter at input
 - **Do not** need a amplifer at input and output
 - May need a bandpass near output
 - Think how to design the output impandance to be **50ohms**
 - The output bandpass may use **butterworth**
 - The gain can be not considered
 - The input can be designed to be any range between `300M-3GHz`, `1850-1910MHz` is ok
