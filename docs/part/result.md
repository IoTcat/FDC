# Result and Testing

## Result

![res1](/img/res1.jpg)

This figure shows the front of the manufactured PCB. As it shown, all the SMD components was not solded on the PCB and only the IC and Balun was solded and wires were printed and holes was drilled, since the workshop in university did not do SMT. When we contracted the workshop technicists, they did tell us that they can not do this, however, we did not quitly understand him at that time.

This figure shows the back side of the PCB result. It can be shown that this side was copper plated to eliminate the effect of ground line. 

## Test Produre

### Equipments

![sa](/img/sa.jpg)

The most important (and the most expensive) equipment is the spectrum analyzer, which was shown in the above figure. This equipment can display the signal in frequency domain. However, this type of spectrum analyzer can only accept one input at one time, so we may need to the target separatly and combine them together maybe use Photoshop.

Besides, High-Frequency signal generator, DC power supplier are also needed in this case.

## Test Steps

 - Give a RF input without LO input and measure the output
 - Give a LO input without RF input and measure the output
 - Give both RF and LO input and measure the output
 - Measure the range of RF frequency that it can work
 - Measure the range of LO frequenct that it can work
